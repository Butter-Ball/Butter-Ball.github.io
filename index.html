			<p class=" col-lg-8 offset-lg-1">For those looking for a superior team based experience, you are in the right place. Awaiting Orders is a mature, teamwork based clan for those who want to both lead and be a part of top grade squads. Sound like something you’ve heard before? Probably. Many clans fly the flag of “teamwork” but don’t live up to it. In such clans, 12-year-olds run around the field not giving a flying f*ck about what the “assigned” squad leader is telling them. I am here to tell you, in Awaiting Orders, this will not be the case. <br></br>The orders of squad leaders are always expected to  be followed to the letter.The way we approach the squad leader position is also different. Every game, the squad leader position is rotated. I am not recruiting for a clan in which I am the one and only commander. Here are our <b>ROCK SOLID</b> expectations, so you can get an idea of what we are all about.</p>

			<p class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-1">To apply for AO, send FN_21M87 the following message on PSN: "I am awaiting orders". I will reply to your message with a date and time for an interview within 48 hours. It is my personal goal to craft a clan of great individuals who live up to our values. Entry is by no means guaranteed, even if you meet the basic requirements and list off our expectations. Good luck, and I will see you on the battlefield - hopefully in my squad, and not at the end of my sights.<p>
